# TextSpammer
Just a quick spammer program that I made for spamming a group chat; may be updated in the future  
Update: Now I want to try to make a spammer with a bunch of different programming languages
## USAGE:
Run the program (varies depending on programming language), and answer the prompt for the time between spams, the filename, and the mode for the spammer. It will wait for 5 seconds before commencing spamming.
### Modes: 
s:  prints every line from text file with newlines in between  
b: concatenates all lines in text file into one big line and presses enter  
m: manual spamming; you enter what you want spammed and how many times you need it spammed  
## NOTE:
There will be a space of 5 seconds before the program will start the spamming; in this time, click the text box where you need it spammed (i.e., the discord message writing section). The spammer cannot be stopped after it starts easily; use at your own risk.
## TERMS OF USE:
You can use it under the license provided, but also cannot terrorize any group chats with this software.
